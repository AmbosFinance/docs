# Loan Terms

## # Repayment Schedule

Loans have no repayment schedule. You can choose to repay whenever, provided:

1. You have not been fully liquidated (in which case there is nothing to repay)
2. You repay the accrued interest over the lifetime of the loan

## Interest

Interest in Aave is different to traditional loans. There is currently no fixed interest rate for a loan, and it will vary based on how many other people are trying to borrow at the same time.

For this reason you might see interest rates change when logging into the app at different times.&#x20;

When you take out a loan, you will begin accruing interest. This interest _will change as the interest rate changes._

To give you a rough indication of rates: rates for Aave loans have typically been around 3-5% per year, but as of late 2023, have been varying between 5 - 15%. You should be comfortable with an average rate somewhere between the two.
