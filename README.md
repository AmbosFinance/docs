# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Ambos

## What is Ambos?

Ambos is a DeFi (Decentralized Finance) application that lets you easily borrow fiat currencies and stablecoins, using Ether (ETH)\* as collateral. Importantly, Ambos never holds your crypto - **you stay in control the whole time.**&#x20;

## Why Borrow with Ambos?

Ambos is for people who want access to liquidity _today,_ while keeping the upside of holding ETH _tomorrow._&#x20;

**For example:**

**Alice** bought a couple of ETH during the 2021 crypto bull-run. She believes that ETH will rebound and doesn't want to sell at the bottom, but really wants laser eye surgery. She uses an Ambos loan to borrow the USD for her surgery, then repays the loan when the value of her ETH recovers.

**Beatriz** is holding his ETH in a Ledger hardware wallet, as he doesn't trust a Centralised Exchange to hold his crypto. He uses Ambos to borrow USDC to pay for his rent and utilities, knowing that he is in control of his ETH the whole time.&#x20;

**Colin** has a tech startup. He did a job and got paid in crypto. He wants to use the crypto to bootstrap the first few months of his startup while he develops his MVP. Ambos makes this process simple.

## Why Ambos?

Taking out a loan in DeFi has typically been an extremely complicated experience that requires deep expertise.&#x20;

In contrast, Ambos streamlines the process of getting a DeFi loan, providing:&#x20;

* **A simplified loan experience:** with integrated on-off ramps for easy fiat conversion&#x20;
* **No private keys needed:** options to use either traditional login methods (such as Google, Apple ID, Email), for a familar login experience, or login with a crypto wallet you already own.&#x20;
* **Best-in-class security:** using the largest and most secure DeFi loans platform, Aave, under-the-hood to safely store your collateral Sensible defaults and protections for borrowers: that reduce the chance of making an error whilst borrowing.&#x20;
* **Low fees:** using Ethereum Layer 2s&#x20;
