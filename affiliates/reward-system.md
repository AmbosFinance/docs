# üéÅ Reward System

The beauty of the Ambos referral scheme lies in its generous reward system. Here's how it's structured:\


* Level 1: For every direct referral, earn 20% of Ambos' commission (that's 1% of the loan amount). For example, if you invite one friend called Lucas and Lucas takes out a 1000$ loan, you would earn 2$ \[20% of (1% of 1000$].\

* Level 2: For every secondary referral, earn 10% of Ambos' commssion. For example, if you invite one friend called Lucas and invites a friend called Marcus (who takes out a 1000$ loan), you would earn 1$ \[10% of (1% of 1000$].\

* Level 3: For tertiary referrals, you'll receive 5% of Ambos' commssion**.** For example, if you invite one friend called Lucas and invites a friend called Marcus, which then invites a friend of his called Francis (who takes out a 1000$ loan), you would earn 0.50$ \[5% of (1% of 1000$].\
  \
  Let's say you complete all three tiers of the system with one friend who then invites a second friend who then invites a third friend and they all take out 1000$ loans. You would earn a total of 3.50$ just from that initial friend you referred! \
  The structure is not limited in terms of number of friends you can refer, this means that if you invite 100 friends that get you a Level 3 referral, you would earn 3.50$ x 100= 350$!

This tiered reward structure ensures that the more active you are in promoting Ambos, the more you stand to gain!
