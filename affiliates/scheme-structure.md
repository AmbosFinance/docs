# 📐 Scheme Structure

Ambos's referral scheme is constructed with a multi-level architecture, ensuring a wide reach while rewarding users at different tiers. At its core, the program is structured as follows:



Level 1: Direct referrals made by you.

Level 2: Users brought in by your direct referrals.

Level 3: Referrals made by those in Level 2.

This hierarchical setup not only incentivizes users to refer more but also creates a network effect, exponentially increasing both your potential earnings and Ambos's reach.
